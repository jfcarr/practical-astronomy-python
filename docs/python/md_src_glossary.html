<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Astronomical Ephemeris</h1>
<p><em>see Astronomical Almanac.</em></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
astronomical latitude</h1>
<p>The angle between the astronomical zenith and the equator.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
astronomical unit</h1>
<p>Approximately equal to the length of the semi-major axis of the Earth’s orbit about the Sun, 1.496 × 10 11 metres.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>

<p>The apparent shift in the position of a celestial object due to the bending of light rays by the atmosphere.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md16"></a>
calendar</h1>
<p>System of accounting the days in the year. The <b>Julian calendar</b>, introduced by Julius Caesar, divides the year into 365 days except for every fourth year which has 366. The <b>Gregorian calendar</b>, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII (1502–1585) in 1582 and accepted in England in 1752, is the one generally in use in the West today. It reduced the errors in the Julian calendar by removing three days every four centuries; if the year ends in two noughts it is only a leap year if it is divisible by 400. So, for example, 2000 was a leap year, but 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. 2100 will not be a leap year either.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md17"></a>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
coordinate systems</h1>
<p>Frames of reference by means of which the position of any point can be uniquely specified. In astronomy, the systems take their names from the fundamental planes on which they are based. Thus the <b>ecliptic coordinate system</b> measures longitude round from the first point of Aries, in the plane of the ecliptic and latitude northwards from it. The <b>equatorial coordinate system</b> measures right ascension round from Aries in the plane of the Earth’s equator, and declination northwards from it. In the <b>horizon coordinate system</b>, the azimuth is measured round from the north point in the sense NESW and the altitude is the angle up from the horizon. The <b>galactic coordinate system</b> specifies position by longitude measured in the galactic plane round from the direction of the galactic centre and by latitude measured perpendicular to the plane. <b>Heliographic coordinates</b> enable the position of an object on the surface of the Sun to be specified with respect to the solar equator and a fundamental meridian assumed to rotate at a uniform rate. <b>Selenographic coordinates</b> define positions on the surface of the Moon with respect to the lunar equator and the mean <b>sub-Earth point</b>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
coordinated universal time (UTC)</h1>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md24"></a>
culmination</h1>
<p>The moment at which a celestial body crosses the observer’s meridian. Circumpolar stars cross the meridian above the horizon twice in one day, giving <b>upper culmination</b> and <b>lower culmination</b>.</p>

If, at the moment of greatest eclipse, the Moon or Sun is only partly obscured it is a <b>partial eclipse</b>; if completely obscured it is a <b>total eclipse</b>. If during a solar eclipse the Moon obscures the central part of the Sun’s disc but leaves an unobscured ring around its edge, then it is an <b>annular eclipse</b>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md32"></a>
ecliptic</h1>
<p>The plane containing the orbit of the Earth about the Sun.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md33"></a>
ellipse</h1>
<p>A type of regular closed curve, oval in shape, of which a circle is a special case. It is traced by a point moving in such a manner that it keeps constant the sum of its distances from two fixed points, each of which is called a <b>focus</b> of the ellipse. The longest diameter of the ellipse, which goes through both foci and the centre, is called the <b>major axis</b>, the portion from the centre to the curve in either direction being called the <b>semi-major axis</b>.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md49"></a>
GPS time</h1>
<p>An atomic time kept by the US Naval Observatory and broadcast by the satellites of the global positioning system.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md119"></a>
atomic time</h2>
<p>Time measured with respect to the natural period of oscillations of an atomic system. Caesium beam clocks currently constitute the most precise time-keepers available, and the SI unit of atomic time is defined in terms of the caesium 133 atom (see <b>second</b>). <b>International atomic time (TAI)</b> is the continuous scale resulting from analyses by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures of atomic time standards in many countries, starting from the epoch 1958 January 1. <b>Coordinated universal time</b> (UTC) is the time scale distributed by standard time services and is tied to both TAI and UT in such a manner that (a) it differs from TAI by a whole number of seconds, and (b) it is never more than 0.9 s different from UT (strictly UT1). This is achieved by the introduction of leap seconds into UTC from time to time. UTC constitutes the basis for legal time keeping in most parts of the world. <b>Terrestrial time (TT)</b> (<b>called terrestrial dynamic time (TDT)</b> until 1991) is used as the argument in theories of celestial dynamics and in the compilation of the <em>Astronomical Almanac</em>. It is equal to TAI +32.184 s. <b>TDT</b> had replaced <b>ephemeris time (ET)</b> in 1984, which was itself derived from analyses of the Moon’s motion.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md120"></a>
solar time</h2>
<p>Time measured with respect to the motion of the Sun or a fictitious body, no longer used, called the mean Sun (<b>mean solar time</b>). <b>Universal time (UT)</b> is, broadly speaking, the mean solar time as measured on the Greenwich meridian. It is formally defined by a mathematical formula as a function of <b>sidereal time</b> (see below), and is thus determined from observations of the stars. A direct application of the formula gives UT0; with a small correction for polar motion the scale UT1 is obtained. Whenever the term UT is used, UT1 is usually implied. <b>British summer time (BST)</b> is 1 hour ahead of UT and is an example of <b>daylight saving time</b> in which the time is adjusted to make the working day fit more conveniently into the daylight hours.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md121"></a>
sidereal time</h2>
<p>Time measured with respect to the apparent motion of the stars. The <b>local sidereal time</b> at any place is equal to the hour angle of the first point of Aries; local sidereal time on the Greenwich meridian is called <b>Greenwich sidereal time</b>. The difference between <b>apparent sidereal time</b> and <b>mean sidereal time</b> is called the <b>equation of the equinoxes</b>, and takes account of <b>nutation</b>. It may be as much as 1.2 seconds.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md122"></a>
time zone</h1>
<p>A longitudinal strip on the surface of the Earth in which the <b>zone time</b>, usually a whole number of hours before or after UT, is adopted as the local civil time by national or international agreement.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md123"></a>
transit</h1>
<p>The moment at which a celestial body crosses the observer’s meridian.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md124"></a>
twilight</h1>
<p>That period of semi-darkness after sunset or before sunrise during which the sun’s zenith distance is more than 90◦ but less than some agreed figure. This figure is 108◦ for <b>astronomical twilight</b> and 102◦ for <b>nautical twilight</b>, while for <b>civil twilight</b> it is 96◦.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md125"></a>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md128"></a>
vernal equinox</h1>
<p>see <b>equinox</b>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md129"></a>
year</h1>
<p>The interval between two successive passages of the Sun through a reference point. A particular point among the stars is used as reference in the <b>sidereal year</b>, equal to 365.2564 mean solar days. The <b>tropical year</b>, 365.242 191 mean solar days, uses the first point of Aries as its reference. When no qualifying adjective is used with the word 'year', it is usually the tropical year that is meant. Perturbations to the Earth’s orbit by the other planets cause small changes in the Earth’s orbital elements. The <b>anomalistic year</b>, 365.2596 mean solar days, is the interval between two successive passages of the Sun through perigee. The <b>Besselian year</b>, not used since 1984, is the period of one complete revolution in right ascension of the fictitious mean Sun as defined by the astronomer Simon Newcomb (1835–1909). It is almost the same as the tropical year, but begins when the right ascension of the Sun is exactly 240◦ ; this instant falls very near the beginning of the <b>civil year</b>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md130"></a>
zenith</h1>
<p>The point directly overhead at the observer. The <b>zenith angle</b> or <b>zenith distance</b> of a star is the angle between the star and the zenith.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md131"></a>
zone correction</h1>
<p>The number of hours that needs to be added to or subtracted from UT to get the <b>zone time</b>. </p>
